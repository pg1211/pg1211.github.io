# Personal Portfolio

This repo houses a project being worked on by me, Prakhar Gupta. The end goal is to have a personal site built using:

* React.js (Framework)
* Tailwind CSS (Styling)
* Vite (Build Tool)
* GH Pages (hosting)
* Firebase (Asset Storage)
---
For now, however, this will just be a fun exercise in learning Tailwind and getting some overall API calling practice.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this!
